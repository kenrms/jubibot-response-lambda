## Installation

To use the AI Response Service, you'll need to deploy the AWS Lambda function to your AWS account. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kenrms/jubibot-response-lambda.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ai-response-service`
3. Deploy the Lambda function using the AWS CLI or your preferred deployment method.

Make sure to set the necessary environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key, before deploying the function.

## Usage

To use the AI Response Service, you'll need to send a POST request to the Lambda function's API Gateway endpoint. The request body should contain the message data that you want the AI to process.

Here's an example of how you can use the service:

```
POST /ai-response
{
"message": "Hello, how can I help you today?"
}
```

The function will then send the message data to the OpenAI API and return the generated response in the response body.
